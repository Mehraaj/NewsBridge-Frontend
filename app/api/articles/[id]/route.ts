The discovery, made using advanced LiDAR technology, reveals sophisticated urban planning and agricultural systems dating back over 1,000 years. The site spans approximately 50 square kilometers and includes complex irrigation networks, ceremonial structures, and residential areas. This finding challenges previous assumptions about pre-Columbian societies in the Amazon basin. The research team, led by international archaeologists, believes this civilization may have supported a population of over 100,000 people. The discovery provides new insights into sustainable land management practices that could inform modern conservation efforts.",
